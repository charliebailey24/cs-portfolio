    "I learned several things doing this math reading activity. The biggest takeaway I had was the importance of building internal mental models for how to solve a problem rather than immediately \"pattern matching\" for external templates of possible solutions. This was my first reaction. As soon as I saw the equations, I was immediately thinking of equations I'd seen in Linear Algebra and how I would solve the problem using matrices. While this may have solved the problem, it wasn't a deep understanding of what was really being asked. When we switched to thinking about the problem as making change, I was again thrown by existing models of the coin change problem from Algorithms. I still have difficulty now breaking the problem down to its core components when I think about it. At it's core though, it is a minimization problem that can be understood in a very concrete manner when thinking about it in terms of making change.\n",

    "As we can see from this example, as the number of days it takes to recover increases, the epidemic threshold size of the susceptible population decreases. Intuitively this makes senseâ€”if we hold the transmission coefficient steady and increase the number of days it takes to recovery, this allows for a higher probability of contact and faster spread of the illness, which results in a smaller susceptible population needed to create an epidemic."
