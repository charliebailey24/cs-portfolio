## Project Experience

### Bitcoin Price Prediction — LSTM vs. GRU (TensorFlow 2.x)

- Built and tuned LSTM/GRU one-step forecasters; GRU model (RMSE 1294.84) **narrowly outperformed a persistence baseline** (RMSE 1299.10), demonstrating the difficulty of the task.
- Documented setup, metrics, and Apple Silicon GPU path; includes PDF report and requirements.

### Histopathologic Cancer Detection (PCam/Kaggle) — CNN (Keras)

- Classified 96×96 pathology patches using a custom CNN with BatchNorm, Dropout, and early stopping to mitigate overfitting.
- **Achieved validation AUC ≈ 0.96 (vs. 0.87 baseline)** on a subset of data; documented augmentation and training pipeline.

### Approximate Q-Learning Agent (LunarLander-v3) — From Scratch

- Implemented custom approximate Q-learning agent with RBF features and ε-greedy exploration for continuous state spaces.
- Validated agent learning on CartPole; analyzed feature scaling for LunarLander; modular environment code; foundation for DQN extensions.
- Stack: Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, RBFSampler, Gymnasium.
