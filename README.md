## Projects

All projects contain a detailed report in the linked GitHub repo.

### [Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning Agent](https://github.com/charliebailey24/RL-agent/tree/main)

From scratch Approximate Q-learning agent with RBF feature extraction and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for Gymnasium's LunarLander-v3 environment.

### [BTC Price Prediction](https://github.com/charliebailey24/btc-prediction-model)

A deep learning approach to cryptocurrency price prediction using LSTM and GRU architectures, achieving better than baseline performance through systematic optimization.

### [Histopathological Cancer Detection](https://github.com/charliebailey24/cancer-detection)

Implemented a TensorFlow CNN to identify metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections.

### [Gradient Descent Implementation](https://github.com/charliebailey24/gradient-descent-implementation)

A ground-up implementation of the gradient descent algorithm‚Äîbuilt from first principles.
